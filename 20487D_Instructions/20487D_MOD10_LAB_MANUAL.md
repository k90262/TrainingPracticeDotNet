# Module 10: Scaling Services

# Lab: Load Balancing Azure Web Apps

### Exercise 1: Prepare the Application for Load Balancing

#### Task 1: Add code to print out the server name

1. In the Microsoft Azure portal, create an Azure web app.
2. In Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Open the *[Repository Root]***\AllFiles\Mod10\Labfiles\Lab1\Starter**.
3. Create a new folder and name it **Middleware**. In this folder, create a new file, and name it **MachineNameMiddleware.cs**.
4. In the **MachineNameMiddleware.cs** file, add a **RequestDelegate** instance, and initiate it as the constructor.
5. To add the **X-BlueYonder-Server** header with **MachineName** as the value, add the **Invoke** method.
6. In **IApplicationBuilder**, add an extension method.
7. In the **Configure** method, inside the **Startup** class, add **Exception Handling Middleware**.

#### Task 2: Deploy the application to an Azure web app

1. Publish the **blueyonder**{YourInitials} service.
2. Open the Azure portal, and then click the **blueyonder**{YourInitials} service.
3. In the **Settings** section, click **Scale up (App Service plan)**.
4. On the **Dev/Test** tab, in the **Recommended pricing tiers** box, enter **B1**.

#### Task 3: Configure the web app for multiple instances

1. In the **Settings** section, click **Scale out (App Service plan)**.
2. On the **Configure** tab, increase the **Override condition** scale to **2**.

### Exercise 2: Test the Load Balancing with Instance Affinity

#### Task 1: Browse the website multiple times

1. Open Microsoft Edge, and then browse to the following URL:
   ```url
   https://blueyonder{YourInitials}.azurewebsites.net/api/destinations
   ```
2. Verify that the response has a list of destinations in JSON.

#### Task 2: Verify that you reach the same server each time

1. In Microsoft Edge, open **Developer Tools**, and then click the **Network** tab.
2. Browse to the following URL:
   ```url
   https://blueyonder{YourInitials}.azurewebsites.net/api/destinations
   ```
3. Verify that the response has a list of destinations in JSON.
4. In the **Network** tab, locate the following URL:
   ```url
    https://blueyonder{YourInitials}.azurewebsites.net/api/destinations
   ```
 5. In the **Response Headers** section, locate the **X-BlueYonder-Server**, and then verify that the **Status** is **200**.

### Exercise 3: Test the Load Balancing Without Affinity

#### Task 1: Update the application to not use affinity

1. In the Azure portal, click the **blueyonder**{YourInitials} web app.
2. Click **Application settings**. In the **Settings** section, click **General settings**.
3. In **General settings**, switch **ARR Affinity** to **Off**.

#### Task 2: Retest and verify that you reached more than one instance

1. In Microsoft Edge, refresh the page a couple of times.
2. View the response with all the destinations as the previous exercise.
3. In the **Network** tab,  view **X-BlueYonder-Server**.
   > **Note**: Now there are two server instances in **X-BlueYonder-Server**, because of which you can get two different values for **machine name**.

# Lab: Load Balancing with Azure Traffic Manager

### Exercise 1: Deploy an Azure Web App to Multiple Regions

#### Task 1: Deploy an Azure web app to the West Europe region

1. Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator.
2. From the **[repository root]\AllFiles\Mod10\Labfiles\Lab2\Setup** directory, run the following command:
   ```batch
    .\createAzureServicesWestEurope.ps1
   ```
3. Sign in with your **Subscription ID** and follow the on-screen instructions.

#### Task 2: Deploy an Azure web app to the West US region

1.  Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2.  From the **[repository root]\AllFiles\Mod10\Labfiles\Lab2\Setup** directory, run the following command:
    ```batch
     .\createAzureServicesWestUS.ps1
    ```
3.  Sign in with your **Subscription ID** and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Exercise 2: Create an Azure Traffic Manager Profile

#### Task 1: Create an Azure Traffic Manager profile in the Azure portal

1. Create a Traffic Manager profile with the **Priority** routing method.

#### Task 2: Configure the profile to point to the two Azure web apps

1. In the Traffic Manager profile, create the primary end point.
2. In **Type**, select **Azure endpoint**.
3. In **Target resource type**, select **App Service**.
4. In the **Priority** box, enter **1**.
5. In the Traffic Manager profile, create the primary end point.
6. In **Type**, select **Azure endpoint**.
7. In **Target resource type**, select **App Service**.
8. In the **Priority** box, enter **2**.

#### Task 3: Test the Azure Traffic Manager DNS resolver by checking which instance of the app was reached

1. Browse to the following URL:
    ```url
    http://blueyondermod10lab2TM{YourInitials}.trafficmanager.net/api/destinations
    ```
   >**Note**: All requests are routed to the primary end point that is set to Priority 1.
2. To find our trafficmanager, run the following command:
    ```bash
    nslookup blueyondermod10lab2TM{YourInitials}.trafficmanager.net
    ```
3. Verify that the primary end point is the **blueyondermod10lab2t1{YourInitials}** service.
4. In Azure Traffic Manager, in the **Settings** section, in **myPrimaryEndpoint**, change the **Status** to **Disabled**.
5. Browse to the following URL:
    ```url
    http://blueyondermod10lab2TM{YourInitials}.trafficmanager.net/api/destinations
    ```
   > **Note**: All requests are routed to the secondary end point that is set to Priority 2.
6. To find our trafficmanager, run the following command:
    ```bash
    nslookup blueyondermod10lab2TM{YourInitials}.trafficmanager.net
    ```
7. Verify that the secondary endpoint is the **blueyondermod10lab2t2{YourInitials}** service.
8. Close all open windows.
