# Module 3: Creating and Consuming ASP.NET Core Web APIs 

# Lab: Creating an ASP.NET Core Web API 

#### Scenario

In this lab, you will create and use ASP.NET Core Web APIs.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a Web API controller to expose APIs.
- Invoke the API through a browser.
- Use **httpClient**, create **ConsoleApplication**, and then connect to the server by using **httpClient**.


### Exercise 1: Create a Controller Class
 
#### Task 1: Add a controller class

1. Open Command Prompt, and then browse to **[Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod03\LabFiles\Lab1\Starter**.
2. Open the project in Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
3. In the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Service** project, add a new controller called **HotelBookingController**.
4. In **HotelBookingController**, add the **HotelBookingRepository** field, and then initialize the field by using the constructor.

#### Task 2: Add action methods to the controller for GET, POST, and PUT

1. Add a new **GET** action with the *id* parameter, and then return the **Booking** entity.
2. Add a new **POST** action with the *Booking* parameter, and then return the **Booking** entity.
3. Add a new **PUT** action with the *id* and *Booking* parameters, and then return the **Booking** entity.

### Exercise 2: Use the API from a Browser

#### Task 1: Use a browser to access the GET action

1. Run the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Service** project.
2. Open a browser,  and navigate to the following URL:
   ```url
    http://localhost:5000/api/HotelBooking/1
   ```
   >**Note**: If there is an error in the Console after running the application, run the following command: **dotnet dev-certs https --trust**.
3. Close all open windows.
   >**Result:** You should see the **Booking** reservation with **Booking Id: 1**.

### Exercise 3: Create a Client

#### Task 1: Create a console project and add a reference to System.Net.Http

1. To change the directory to the Starter project, run the following command:
   ```bash
    cd [Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod03\LabFiles\Lab1\Starter
   ```
2. Create a new console application called **BlueYonder.Hotels.Client**.
3. Add the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Client** project to the solution.
4. In the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Client** project, install the **Microsoft AspNet WebApi Client** package.

#### Task 2: Use HttpClient to Call the GET and PUT Actions of the Controller

1. Open the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Client** project in Visual Studio Code.
2. In **BlueYonder.Hotels.Client.csproj**, add a reference DAL class library.
3. In **Program.cs**, change the **Main** method return type declaration to **async Task**.
4. In the **Main** method, create a new **HttpClient** instance.
5. Inside the **HttpClient** bracket, create a **HotelBooking GET** request, and pass **id=1** to it.
6. To read the content of the response as a string, under **HttpResponseMessage**, use **ReadAsStringAsync**, and print the result to the console.
7. Read the content of the response as a **Booking** entity.
8. Change the **Paid** property of the response to **false**.
9. Create a **PUT** request, and then pass the **id=1** to it, and the response a **Booking** entity.
10. Read the content of the **PUT** response as a string, and print the result to the console.
11. Run the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Service** project.
12. Run the **BlueYonder.Hotels.Client** project.
13. At the command prompt, verify that the bookings from the **GET** and the **PUT** requests appear. 
14. Close all open windows.
