# Lab: Monitoring ASP.NET Core with ETW and LTTng 

#### Scenario

In this lab, you will use Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) on Windows and LTTng on Linux to monitor exception and garbage collection (GC) events in a Microsoft ASP.NET Core application.

#### Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:
-	Collect and analyze ETW events with PerfView for an ASP.NET Core application on Windows.
-	Collect and analyze LTTng events for an ASP.NET Core application on a Linux Docker container.

### Exercise 1: Collect and view ETW events
 
#### Task 1: Run the ASP.NET Core application

1. Open the command prompt, and then navigate to **[Repository Root]\AllFiles\Mod08\Labfiles\Lab1\Blueyonder.Service** folder.
2. Run the project.

#### Task 2: Record .NET ETW events in PerfView

 1. Open **PerfView**, and then collect all the events.

#### Task 3: Run a script to invoke service and make it to throw exceptions 

1. In PowerShell, from the **assets** folder, run the **requestsToServer** script.
2. Switch to **PerfView** and stop collecting the events.

#### Task 4: View exception details and call stacks in PerfView

1. In **Advanced Group**, click **Exceptions Stacks**.
2. Locate the **Blueyonder.Service** process.
3. Locate the exception and view the call stack.

### Exercise 2: Collect and view LTTng events

#### Task 1: Run the ASP.NET Core application in a Linux container with COMPlus_EventLogEnabled=1

1. Open the command prompt, and then navigate to the **[Repository Root]\AllFiles\Mod08\Labfiles\Lab1\Blueyonder.Service** folder.
2. Run the project in docker on port **8080:80** and name **myapp**.

#### Task 2: Record LTTng events with the Lttng CLI tool

1. Enter to **myapp** container the shell.
2. Update the packages in the container.
3. Install the **software-properties-common** package.
4. Add **PPA repository**.
5. Install the **LTTng** package.
6. Create a session in **LTTng**.
7. Run a command to add context data (process id, thread id, process name) to each event.
8. Run a command to create an event rule to record all the events starting with **DotNETRuntime**.
9. Start recording events.
10. Open the browser and navigate to the service a few times.

#### Task 3: View LTTng exception and GC events with the babeltrace CLI tool

1. Stop recording the events, and then destroy the session.
2. To view all the recorded events, run the **babeltrace** command.

#### Task 4: Open the recording file on Windows with PerfView

1. To install **Zip** package, run the following command:
   ```bash
   apt-get install zip
   ```
2. To archive the **trace** folder, paste the following command, press the **Tab** key, and then press the **Enter** key:
   ```bash
   zip -r sample.trace.zip /root/lttng-traces/sample-trace
   ```
3. Copy the archive to the local file system.
4. Remove the **myapp** container.
5. Open the zip file in PerfView and look at the events.
6. Close all open windows.

# Lab: Monitoring Azure Web Apps with Application Insights

#### Scenario

   >**Note**: If prompted for trust this repository, Type **A** and then press **Enter**.
4. Navigate to *[repository root]***\AllFiles\Mod08\Labfiles\Lab2\Setup**.
5. Run the following command:
    ```batch
     .\createAzureServices.ps1
    ```
6. You will be asked to supply a subscription ID, which you can get by performing the following steps:
    1. Open a browser and navigate to **http://portal.azure.com**. If a page appears, asking for your email address, enter your email address, and then click **Continue**. Wait for the **Sign-in** page to appear, enter your email address and password, and then click **Sign In**.
