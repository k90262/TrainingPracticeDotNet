# Module 3: Creating and Consuming ASP.NET Core Web APIs 

# Lab: Creating an ASP.NET Core Web API

1. Wherever a path to a file starts with *[Repository Root]*, replace it with the absolute path to the folder in which the 20487 repository resides. 
 For example, if you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487**, change the path: **[Repository Root]\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01** to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01**.
2. Wherever *{YourInitials}* appears, replace it with your actual initials. (for example, the initials for John Doe will be jd).
3. Before performing the demonstration, you should allow some time for the provisioning of the different Microsoft Azure resources required for the demonstration. You should review the demonstrations before the actual class, identify the resources, and then prepare them beforehand to save classroom time.

    dotnet run
    ```
4. Open a browser, and navigate to the following URL:
   ```url
   http://localhost:5000/api/HotelBooking/1
   ```
   >**Note**: If there is an error in the Console after running the application, run the following command dotnet **dev-certs https --trust**.
5. Verify that the **Booking** reservation with **Booking Id: 1** appears.
6. To Stop the Application, in command prompt, Press **Ctrl+C**.
